<p>Propositional logic cannot express the meaning of all statements in mathematics and in natural language. For example, suppose that we know that \[\text{"Every computer connected to the university network is functioning properly"}\] No rules of propositional logic allow us to conclude the truth of the statement \[\text{"COMP1 is funtioning properly"}\] where \(\text{COMP1}\) is one of the computers connected to the university network.</p>
