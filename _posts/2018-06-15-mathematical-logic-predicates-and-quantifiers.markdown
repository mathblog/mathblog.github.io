<p>Propositional logic cannot express the meaning of all statements in mathematics and in natural language. For example, suppose that we know that <span style="overflow:auto;">\[\text{"Every computer connected to the university network is functioning properly"}\]</span> No rules of propositional logic allow us to conclude the truth of the statement <span style="overflow:auto;">\[\text{"COMP1 is funtioning properly"}\]</span> where \(\text{COMP1}\) is one of the computers connected to the university network.</p>
